- [ ] Pooling/garbage collection of structures
- [ ] Revisit connect logic to match GO Client
- [x] Revisit FlushTimeout to match GO Client
- [ ] Revisit Flusher for the aggregation of more data before socket write
- [ ] Decide if we go full non-blocking sockets, so we can apply deadline to all read/writes
- [x] Improve Request/Reply performance (*Solved by doing explicit flushing after sending the reply. The original performance issue is due to the way the flusher is implemented, whereby we sleep a millisecond to accumulate more work. So that limited the rate to 1000 messages/sec*).  
- [ ] Make sure Inboxes are really unique (use of srand + seq for now)
- [x] Port for Linux (~~may work as-is~~, need to check)
- [ ] Port for Windows + Makefile
- [ ] Some tests are not ported because they require a mockup server
